Warning
Please
install
a
protection
circuit
on
the
exterior
of
PLC
so
that
the
whole
system
may
operate
safely
regardless
of
failures
from
external
power
or
PLC.
Any
abnormal
output
or
operation
from
PLC
may
cause
serious
problems
to
safety
in
whole
system.
Install
protection
units
on
the
exterior
of
PLC
like
an
interlock
circuit
that
deals
with
opposite
operations
such
as
emergency
stop,
protection
circuit,
and
forward/reverse
rotation
or
install
an
interlock
circuit
that
deals
with
high/low
limit
under
its
position
controls.
If
any
system
error
(watch-dog
timer
error,
module
installation
error,
etc.)
is
detected
during
CPU
operation
in
PLC,
all
output
signals
are
designed
to
be
turned
off
and
stopped
for
safety.
However,
there
are
cases
when
output
signals
remain
active
due
to
device
failures
in
Relay
and
TR
which
can’t
be
detected.
Thus,
you
are
recommended
to
install
an
addition
circuit
to
monitor
the
output
status
for
those
critical
outputs
which
may
cause
significant
problems.
Never
overload
more
than
rated
current
of
output
module
nor
allow
to
have
a
short
circuit
.
Over
current
for
a
long
period
time
maycause
a
fire
.
Never
let
the
external
power
of
the
output
circuit
to
be
on
earlier
than
PLC
power
,
which
may
cause
accidents
from
abnormal
output
oroperation.
Please install interlock
circuits in the sequence program for safe operations in the system
when
exchange data with PLC or modify operation modes using a computer or other
external

means.
In

this

means
that

EIP
Service
EtherNet/IP is divided into a periodic message service (Implicit Service), and an aperiodic message
service (Explicit
Service).
In
XGL-EIPT
module
these
two
services
are
incorporated
to
be
provided
as
periodic/client
server
and
aperiodic
client.
In
Periodic
Client
/
Server
Service
the
tag
for
communication
must
be
set
up
in
parameter
system.
Thus,
client
and
server
tag
must
be
shared
with
information
for
communication
when
parameter
is
exchanged.
In
XGT
EhterNet/IP
I/F
module,
client
and
server
must
be
set
up
with
XG5000.
Make
sure
client
is
set
up
in
periodic
client
and
sever
is
set
up
with
periodic
server.
For
the
detail
contents,
see
6.3.
Aperiodic
client
service
must
be
communicated
after
you
put
the
tag
to
be
communicated
and
communication
set-up.
Thus,
when
required
from
client,
server
receives
al
information
in
frame
and
translates,
and
responds.
In
other
words,
it
is
the
service
without
setting
up
from
server
side.
In
this
part,
EIP
types
and
use
methods
provided
to
a
user
are
described.
The

A

is
supposed
where
RS-232C
cable
is
connected
between
PC
in
which
XG5000
is
installed
and
PLC
#1
station,
and
PLC

PLC
#2
and
PLC
#n
are
connected
with
each
other
via
Ethernet
in
XG5000
of
[Fig.7.4.1].
To
access
the
contents
of
PLC
#1
station
in
the
figure
above,
Local
connection
is
needed
in
XG5000’s
on-line
menu.
After
finishing
accessing
the
contents
of
PLC
#1,
disconnect
the
Local
connection
with
‘Disconnect’
menu.
To
access
the
PLC
#n
station,
select
PLC

by
setting
the
IP

of

and
Base

where
FEnet
module
is
installed
in
the

in
the

and
connect.
Then
logical
connection
between
XG5000
and
PLC
#n
will
be
established
via
RS-232C
and

This
status
is
identical
to
the
status
that
RS-232C
cable
is
connected
between

and
it
is
available
to
execute
all

of
programming,
downloading,
debugging
and
monitoring
as
in

Also,
if
Ethernet
module
(LAN

is
installed
on
PC
where XG5000
is
installed
and
connected
to
the
identical
network
to
PLC,
remote
stage

connection
with
PLC
is
available
via
Ethernet
without

With
the

of

easy
access
to
PLC
is
possible
even
if the
PLC
is
located
at
a

And
re-

is
possible
when

transmits
and
receives
data
as
data
like
TCP,
UDP,
ICMP,
IGMP
uses
IP
(32BYTE).
IP
Address
This
term
means
the
address
on
internet
in
each
computer
composed
of
numbers
and
this
address
consists
of
binary
numbers
in 32BYTE (4BYTE) size to classify each device on internet. IP address is divided
into 2 parts in total and is
composed
of
address
for
classifying
network
and
host
address
for
dividing
hosts.
IP
address
is
classified
into
3
classes
-
A-3
Appendix
(Class)
A/
B/
C
–
according
to
how
many
BYTES
are
allotted
to
network
address
and
host
address.
IP
address
is
unique
one
over
the
world,
so
it is
not
decided
at
discretion
but NIC
(Network
Information
Center),
the
regional
information
net
center

net
is
called
“node,”
respectively.
Packet
This
is
a
bundle
of
data
which
becomes
the
basic
unit
for
transmitting
data
via
network.
In
general
packet
creates
a

in
size
from
tens
to
hundreds
BYTE.
On
the
front
side
of
each
bundle
Header
is
posted
and
the
information
on
which
way
this
bundle
to
be
sent
and
more
information
required
are
added.
PORT
number
This
number
is
an
identifier
used
to
classify
applications
on
TCP/UDP.
On
TCP,
this
PORT
number
is
used
to
decide
to
which
PORT
data
should
be
sent
and
the
program
used
in
general
operation
system
has
each
own
PORT.
Example)
21/tcp:
Telnet
PPP
(Point-to-Point
Protocol)
This
protocol
is
an
agreement
on
telephone
communication
that
allows
packets
to
be
transmitted.
In
other
words,
it
is
the commonest protocol on internet that enables a computer to
be connected to TCP/IP through general telephone
lines
and
modems.
This
protocol
is
similar
to
SLIP,
but
it
is
equipped
with
modern
–
communication
protocol
factors
such
as
error
detection,
data
compression,
etc.,
so
it
displays
excellent
performances
compared
to
SLIP.
Protocol
Protocol
is
the
regulations
on
how
computers
connected
to
network
transmit
and
receive
information
with
each
other.
Protocol
means
the
regulation
for
exchanging
messages
on
high
level
as
the
interface
between
one
device
and
the
Appendix
A-4
other
device
is
specifically
described
on
low
level(For
example,
which
BIT/BYTE
should
go
through
lines)
or
files
are
transmitted
through
internet.
Router
This
device
is
used
to
transmit
data
packets
between
networks.
It
also
judges
whether
to
send
data
packets
to
the
final
destination
or
not
and
whether
to
wait
or
not
if
network
is
busy,
and
which
LAN
to
be
connected
to
from
a
plural
LAN
diverging
point.
In
other
words,
this
device
is
a
special
computer
/software
that
manage
the
connection
for
more
than
two
networks.
Server
This
term
means
the
part
which
passively
responds
to
Client’s
request
and
shares
its
own
resources.
TCP
(Transmission
Control
Protocol)
Transport
Layer
Protocol
for
the
Internet

TCP/IP
(Transmission
Control
Protocol/Internet
Protocol)
This
term
means the
agreement
on
transmission
for communication
between
computers
in
different
model.
This
protocol plays a role that enables the communication between
general PC and medium host, IBM PC and MAC, and
among
medium
or
large
scaled
computers
produced
by
other
manufactures.
This
term
is
used
as
a
general
term
of
the
protocol for transmitting
the information between computer networks and included FTP, Telnet, SMTP, etc. TCP is
divided
into
data
packets
and
transmitted
by
IP,
and
the
packet
transmitted
is
configured
by
TCP
again.
Near-end
crosstalk
Near-end
crosstalk
is
a
kind
of
disturbance
generated
by
the
electricity
from
a
communication
signal
or
a
magnetic
field
that
affect
other
signals
in
neighboring
lines.
In
telephone
line,
near-end
crosstalk
may
cause
some
dialogue
contents
on
other
lines
to
be
heard.
The
phenomenon
generated
by
near-end
crosstalk
is
called
“Electro
Magnetic
Interference.”
This
may
happen
on
small
circuits
in
computer
or
audio
equipments
as
well
as
network
lines.
This
term
may
be
applied
to
optic
signals
that
disturb
each
other.
For
example,
as
seen
in
an
insulated
conductor
of
a
telephone
cable,
if
electrostatic
coupling
or
electromagnetic
coupling
between
one
insulated
conductor
and
the
other
insulated
conductor
occurs
and
the
phone
current
on
one
insulated
conductor
is
derelict
to
other
insulated
conductor,
crosswalk-talk
happens.
Of
these
crosswalk-talks,
the
crosswalk-talk
that
happened
to
a
transmitting
part
called
“Near-end
crosstalk”
and
the
one
that
happened
to
a
receiving
part
is
called
Far-end
crosstalk.
