Safety
Instruction
Safety
Instructions
for
design
process
Warning
Please
install a protection circuit on the exterior of PLC
so that the whole system may
operate
safely
regardless
of
failures
from
external
power
or
PLC.
Any
abnormal
output
or
operation
from
PLC
may
cause
serious
problems
to
safety
in
whole
system.
Install
protection
units
on
the
exterior
of
PLC
like
an
interlock
circuit
that
deals
with
opposite
operations
such
as
emergency
stop,
protection circuit,
and
forward/reverse
rotation
or
install
an
interlock
circuit
that
deals
with
high/low
limit
under
its
position
controls.
If
any
system
error
(watch-dog
timer
error,
module
installation
error,
etc.)
is
detected
during
CPU
operation
in
PLC,
all
output
signals
are
designed
to
be
turned
off
and
stopped
for
safety.
However,
there
are
cases
when
output
signals
remain
active
due
to
device
failures
in
Relay
and
TR
which
can’t
be
detected.
Thus,
you
are
recommended
to
install
an
addition
circuit
to
monitor
the
output
status
for
those
critical
outputs
which
may
cause
significant
problems.
Never
overload
more
than
rated
current
of
output
module
nor
allow
to
have
a
short
circuit
.
Over
current
for
a
long
period
time
may
cause
a
fire
.
Never
let
the
external
power
of
the
output
circuit
to
be
on
earlier
than
PLC
power
,
which
may
cause
accidents
from
abnormal
output
or
operation.
Please
install
interlock
circuits
in
the
sequence
program
for
safe
operations
in
the
system
when exchange data with PLC or modify operation modes using a computer or other

The high speed link is the communication method between the XGB PLC and XGK PLC communication modules
and
data
is
transmitted
and
received
periodically
according
to
the
high
speed
link
parameter
setting.
The
high
speed
link
service
transmits
a
frame
to
the
subnet
broadcast
using
the
UDP
protocol.
Devices
in
the
same
subnet
receive
broadcast
frame
at
the
same
time,
and
if
the
relevant
frame
is
registered
in
the
reception
list,
the
data
it
will
processed.
P2P
service
The P2P service is the client function in the following client/server model. This function requests the server for
reading/writing
data.
When
the
starting
condition
of
each
block
is
On,
this
function
creates
a
request
frame
with
the
protocol
specified
as
the
relevant
channel,
receives
and
processes
the
response.
The
parameter
consists
of
up
to
64
P2P
blocks.
Server
service
Dedicated
communication
(server)
service
is
a
protocol
of
Ethernet
module
that
can
read
and
write
information
and
data of PLC from PC and peripheral devices. Ethernet operates as a server in a communication network and
responds
to
memory
read
or
write
requests
from
an
external
device
or
PC
using
the
XGT
protocol
or
Modbus
TCP
protocol. TCP port 2004 and UDP port 2005 are used for XGT dedicated driver of Ethernet module, and Modbus
TCP
driver
uses
TCP
502.
The
dedicated
service
means
the
server
function
in
the
following
client/server
model.
The
client
connects
to
the
server
and
read
and
write
data
according
to
the
set
protocol.
The

EtherNet
/
IP
service
EtherNet / IP is a protocol that puts Common Industrial Protocol (CIP: Common Industrial Protocol such as DeviceNet,
ControlNet, CompoNet, etc.) to the upper layer to the open protocol Ethernet. EtherNet / IP therefore enables
DeviceNet,
ControlNet,
and
CompoNet
product
developers,
system
integrators
and
users
to
apply
the
same
objects
and profiles to ensure interoperability between multi-vendor and sub-network devices. In addition, it provides two
Ethernet ports, and has built-in switch functions necessary for the existing star method, and is a module for data
transmission
between
PLCs
or
between
PLCs
and
EtherNet

Preparation
for
operating
Ethernet
module
system
configuration
Check the basic elements necessary for the system configuration and select a proper communication
module.
Select
a
cable
for
the
communication
module.
When installing the Communication module, make sure that there is no foreign substance in the base
connector
to
be
mounted,
and

that
the
connector
pin
of
this
module
is
not
damaged.
Ethernet
module
can
be
mounted
on
the
main
base
and

base,
but
it
is
recommended
to
use
it on
the
main
base.
However,
in
case
of

system,
it
can
be
installed
only
on
the
main
base.
When installing the module, insert the raised part of the lower part of the module into the base groove
without connecting the communication cable, and apply enough force until the upper part is completely
locked
with
the
base
locking
device.
If
it
is
not
locked,
there
may
be
abnormality
in
the
interface
with
the
CPU
module.
Cables
used
for
communication
module
should
be
installed
referring
to
the
standard.
Ethernet switches and cables required for communication with the Ethernet module should be selected as
standard
products.

cable,
and
enough
force
until
the
upper
part
is
completely
locked
with
the
base
locking
device.
If
the
lock
is
not
locked,
the
module
may
be
detached
from
the
base
module.
The
XOL-ES4T
/
ES4H
Switch
module
should
be
fixed
to
the
panel
and
supplied
with
a
24

Notes
When
hot
swap
of
each
country
operated
by
Smart
extension
service
is
set
to
Enable
and
the
media
is
set to Auto, each station automatically operates by adjusting the communication speed. If there is
only
100M
of
station
number,
the
system
communicates
with
100M.
When hot swap of each country operated by Smart extension service is set to Disable and the media
is
set
to
Auto,
each
station
automatically
operates
by
adjusting
the
communication
speed
However,
if
100M
and
1G
media
are
mixed,
EB
will
be
detached
when
connecting
to
media
with
different
speeds.
In this case, Smart extension service can be operated after setting communication media setting of
each
station
from
Auto
to
100M.

5.1
Overview
HS
link
is
a
communication
method
between
XGT
PLC
communication
modules
and
can
send
and
receive
data
periodically
by
setting
HS
link
parameter.
In
XG5000,
data
can
be
send
/
received
by
setting
send /
receive
data
size,
period,
area and
storage
area
in
parameter.
High
speed
link
is
a
service
to
send
and
receive
at
the
end
of
PLC
program
when
parameter
is
set.
Therefore,
when
the
send
/ receive cycle is short, the communication module transmits every scan data, which decreases the efficiency due to the
increase of the traffic.
The user can set the send / receive period from a minimum of 5 ms to a maximum of 10 seconds.
The
default
is
200
ms.
However, since HS link service uses subnet broadcast service, it may affect other communication modules using the same
network. Therefore, in order to maximize communication efficiency, the user can set the maximum send / receive size (400
bytes) that can be set per HS link block. This reduces the total number of blocks used and increases communication efficiency.
The
high

function
is
as
follows.

is
explained
as
a

example
when
Ethernet
module
of
station“0”
and
station“1”
sends
and
receives
data.
Station “0” sends 10 words of data in M0000 of block “0” and receives 10 words of data in M0010 of block 1 of station “1”.
Station
“1”
receives
10
words
of

Redundancy
Program

This

explains
how
to
use
High
Speed
Link
in
XGR.
When
configuring
an
XGR
redundant
network
When
configuring
a
redundant
network
in
XGR,
you
can
freely
set
the
A-side
and
B-side
station
numbers
and
IP
addresses.
In
other
words,
the
same
station
number
(IP
address)
or
different
station
number
(IP
address)
can
be
used.
If
you
use
other
station
number,
network
operates
separately.

When
XGR
sends
-
XGK
(I)
receives
Issue
of
sequence
number
When
sending
from
XGR,
the
highest
1
word
must
be
issued
in
the
ladder
program
as
the
sequence
number
(SEQ_NO).
The
sequence
number
is
incremented
by
1
for
each
scan.
User
data
The data sent by the user is set in the remaining part except the top 1 word. In XGR system, master
(communication module of Main base) and standby (communication module of Main base) always provide the
same
service,
so
the
receiver
must
decide
which
data
to
receive.
In
addition,
if
one
cable
is
disconnected
due
to
a
network
failure,
programming
is
required
to
receive
data
from
the
other
side
and
not
receive
data
from
the
disconnected side. Based on the issued sequence number, the receiving side can receive and use the updated
data
whenever
the
sequence
number
is
updated.
Receive
side
input
data
setting
When
the
sequence
number
is updated
as
in
the
case
above,
the
receive-side
receives the
updated
data
of
A-side
or B-side
as
input
data and
updates
the
sequence
number
at
that
time.
In
general,
since
the
standby
communication module is serviced 1 scan later than the master communication module, it always receives the
communication data sent from the master communication module as input data.
Even if data is input from
standby
after
saving
the
master
side
sequence
number,
the
data
is
ignored
because
it
is
the
same
sequence
number.
In
addition,
if
communication
of
one
side
becomes
impossible
due
to
network
line
failure,
sequence
number
is
not
updated
and
communication
data
is
not
received
as
input
data,
thus
communication
duplication
is
possible.

High

function
block
In
XGR
and
XGI,
function
block is used
for
receiving
data
processing.
In
XGK,
there
is no
function
block,
so
you
can
use
the
program written
in
the
below
letter.
Notes
Send/
receive
using
sequence
number
is
a
basic
data
send
/
receive
algorithm
method.
Depending
on
your
application
service,
you
do
not
need
to
use
it
if
you
have
a
specific
data
pattern.
When
XGK(I)
sends
-
XGR
receives
Set
data
send
and
receive
The
XGK
(I)
side
to
be
transmitted
should
use
two
communication
modules
to
service
the
same
data
with
the
same
setting.
At
this
time,
sequence
number
is
not
necessary
and
the
receiving
side
receives
communication
data
coming
into
the
master
as
input
data.
If
STATE
FLAG
is
turned
off
with
STATE
FLAG
as
a
contact
in
the
condition of receiving input data in consideration of network failure, copy the standby data to the master by
SYNC
command
and
receive
the
data.
Notes
Since
the
block
setting
is
the
same
for
A-side
and
B-side,
if
the
station
number
of
the
sending
side
is
different,
the
receiving
block
should
be
Setting

to
twice
the
desired

module.
It
is
the
function
implemented
by function,
block
(command) by parameter setting. There are seven P2P commands available in the Ethernet module: Read, Write,
Write_NC,
Send,
Send_NC,
Receive,
and
ESend.
Up
to
8
P2P
parameters
can
be set on the XG5000 for
P2P service registration and editing.
Each
P2P parameter
consists
of
up
to
64
P2P
blocks.
P2P
parameter
registration
Up
to
eight
P2P
parameters
can
be
set
per
CPU.
Multiple
P2P
parameters
can
be
set
for
the
same
communication
module.
However,
enable
only
one
of
many
P2P
parameters
for
the
same
communication
module.
The
each
P2P
parameter
consists
of
P2P
channel,
P2P
block,
user

definition
and
email.

editing
Up
to
64
P2P
blocks
that
can
be
registered
for
each
P2P
parameter.
A
frame
can
be
registered
separately
for
each
driver.

In
order
to
use

(Send_NC)
In
general
P2P
communication,
request
data
is
sent
to
the
start
condition,
and
after
receiving
a
response,
the request data
is sent
again to
the next start condition. If
you
use Write_NC (Send_NC)
command, data is sent in the next start condition without receiving a response. Therefore, 3) fast data
transmission
is
possible.
Read

the
Bit
specification
means
the
contact

and
the
Byte
and
Word
value
specification
means
the
current

Only
Byte
and
Word
can
be
specified
for
the
data
register
(D).
In
case
of
a
byte
type
command,
the
address
value
will
be
doubled
in
comparison
to
specifying
Word.
In
other
words,
in
case
of
D1234,
%DW1234
is
used
when
Word
is specified,
but
in
case
the
form of
Byte
is
specified,
%DB2468
should
be
used.
When accessing the bit area, it should be expressed in the order of data type unit of memory device.
in order to write the C-th bit of M172, M should be calculated as bit type as below because it is word
device.

Overview
EtherNet
/
IP
communication
method
is
divided
into
Implicit
and
Explicit
communication
method.
Implicit
is
classified
into
Class1 and Explicit is classified into UCMM and Class3. Class1 is divided into producer, consumer model, and UCMM.
Class3 is divided into client and server models. Producer is provided as periodic server, Consumer as periodic client and
UCMM Client is provided as aperiodic client. UCMM Server and Class3 Server need to set up Tag download, not
communication
parameters.
In case of periodic client / server, it is similar to the high speed link of the existing XGT communication service and is
mainly
used
for
periodic
data
transmission
and
reception.
The
aperiodic
client
/
server
method
is
a
communication
method
mainly
used
when
a
specific

occurs.

Period
communication
(Implicit)
method
Implicit Message provided by periodic communication means implicit (implicit) message and contains minimum
header information except the data on the frame.
As a result, the frame itself is a message that does not know
what the data means. This means less header information, which simplifies the process of interpreting frames,
enabling faster data processing. In EtherNet / IP, a connection is established between the client and server as
parameters for data transfer. A client is an object that receives and uses the data received after request a
connection. The server receives a connection request and transmits the data desired by the client in the
requested packet interval (RPI) and the desired method (Unicast / Multicast). Therefore, the client sets up the
Consumed
Tag
and
the
server
sets
up
the
Produced
Tag.
Notes
Implicit
Client
also
generates
data
to
Implicit
Server.
Depending
on
the
type,
the
server
can
set
the
timeout
with
the
data
cycle
given
by
the
client
and
output
to
the
server
module
with
the
data
given
by
the
client.
Non-periodic
communication
(Explicit)
method
Explicit Message, which is provided by aperiodic communication, is an explicit meaning that a message contains
all the information that can be interpreted in the data frame. Therefore, again if it takes some time to analyze the
frame, if the desired message is sent without parameter setting process, the server interprets the frame and
sends
the
response.
Mainly
monitoring
data
is
used
as
non-period
data
rather
than
control
data.

OPC
UA
function
OPC
Unified
Architecture
(IEC
62541)
is
an
interoperability
standard
for
secure
and
reliable
information
exchange,
making
it suitable for industrial applications. Based on client-server model, it is a communication protocol applicable from sensor
level
to
cloud
and
has the
following
features.
Multi
/
cross
platform
support
Unlike
OPC
Classic,
which
was
dependent
on
the
Windows
operating
system,
it
is
not
limited
to
one
operating
system
or
programming
language,
so
it
can
be
operated
on
various
devices(Embedded
Device).
Strong
security
It
supports
authentication
and
authorization
through
signing,
encryption,
and
data
integrity
(consistency,
accuracy,
and
validity).
Authentication
uses
X.509
certificates.
Support
a
Service
Oriented
Architecture
XGT OPC UA server module can access flags, local and global variables set in PLC from OPC UA client. Based on OPC
UA Specification V1.03, binary protocol (UA Binary) is used, and binary can be downloaded from module of Ethernet
module
V6.0
or
higher
and
can
be
used
with
XGK,

The
test
was
conducted
while
installed

panel.
10-1
Chapter
10
EMC
Standard
Panel
The
PLC
is
an
open
type
device
(device
installed
to
another
device)
and
must
be
installed
in
a
control
panel.
This
is
because
an
accident
such
as
electric
shock
does
not
occur
when
a
person
comes
into
contact
with
the
product
(XGT
PLC),
and
the
noise
generated
in
the
PLC
has
the
effect
of
attenuating
the
control
panel.
In
the
case
of
XGT
PLC,
it
is
necessary
to
install
on
a
metal
control
panel
in
order
to
suppress
electromagnetic
waves
(EMI)
emitted
from
the
product.
The
specifications
for
the
control
panel
are
as
follows.
Control
Panel
The
PLC
control
panel
must
have
the
following
features
Use
SPCC
(Cold
Rolled
Mild
Steel)
for
the
control
panel
The
steel
plate
should
be
thicker
than
1.6mm.
Use
isolating
transformers
to
protect
the
power
supply
from
external
surge
voltage.
The
control
panel
must
have
a
structure
which
the
radio
waves
does
not
leak
out.
For
example,
make
the
door
as a box-structure so that the panel body and the door are overlapped each other. This structure reduces the
surge
voltage
generate
by
PLC.
Door
Panel
Seal
To
ensure
good
electrical
contact
with
the
control
panel
or
base
plate,
mask
painting
and
weld
so
that
good
surface
contact
can
be
made
between
the
panel
and
plate.
Power
and
Earth
Wiring
Earthing
and
power
supply
wires
for
the
PLC
system
must
be
connected
as
described
below.
10-2
Chapter
10
EMC
Standard
Earth
the
control
panel
with
a
thick
wire
so
that
a
low
impedance
connection
to
ground
can
be
ensured
even
at
high
frequencies.
The
function
of
LG
(Line
Ground)
and
FG
(Frame
Ground)
terminals
is
to
pass
the
noise
generated
in
the
PLC
system
to
the
ground,
so
an
impedance
that
is
as
low
as
possible
must
be
ensured.
The
earthing
wire
itself
can
generate
the
noise,
so
wire
as
short
and
thick
to
prevent
from
acting
as
an
antenna.
Cable
Extension
cable
processing
High-speed electrical signals flow through the extension cables of the XGT series. Therefore, high frequency noise
waves are radiated from this extension cable. To ensure CE conformity, attach ferrite cores as shown below to the
extension
cable.

How
to
fix
the
cable
in
the
panel
When
fixing
the
extension
cable
of
the
XGT
series
to
the
metal
control
panel,
keep
the
extension
cable
at
least
1
cm
so
that
the
extension
cable
does
not
directly
contact
the
metal
plate.
The
metal
plate
of the
control
panel
has
a
shielding
effect that blocks noise from radio waves, but it can also be a good antenna if a cable that is a source of noise is
connected
nearby.
The
transmission
cable
for
high
speed
signals,
not
limited
to
the
extension
cable,
needs
to
be
kept
as
far
as
possible
from
the
metal
plate
of
the
control
panel

EMC
Standard
10.2
Requirement
to
conform
to
the
Low-voltage
Directive
The
low-voltage
directive
requires
each
device
that
operates
with
the
power
supply
ranging
from
50V
to
1000VAC
and
75V
to
1500VDC
to
satisfy
the
safety
requirements.
Cautions
and
installation
and
wiring
of
the
series
PLC
XGT
series
to
conform
to the low-voltage directive are described in this section. However, LSIS will not guarantee that the overall machinery
manufactured
according
to
the
details
conforms
to
the
below-described
directives.
The
method
of
conformance
to
the
EMC
directive
and
compliance
to
the
EMC
Directive
must
be
determined
by
the
manufacturer
of
the
machinery.
Standards
applicable
to
XGT
series
The XGT PLC complies with EN6100-1 (safety of equipment used in measurement and control laboratories. XGT series
PLCs have been developed in accordance with the above standards for modules operating at rated voltage of AC50V /
DC75V
or
higher.
Selection
of
XGT
Series
PLC
Power
supply
module
There are dangerous voltages (higher than 42.4V peak) inside the power supply modules of the Rated input voltage
AC110/ 220Vtes. Therefore, the CE mark-compliant models feature enhanced insulation strong primary and secondary
windings.
I/O

(voltages
higher
than
42.4V
peak)
inside
the
I/O
modules
of
the
AC110/220V
rated
I/O
voltages. Therefore, the CE mark-compliant models are enhanced in insulation internally between the primary and
secondary.
The
I/O
modules
of
DC24V
Rated
input
are
out
of
the
low-voltage
directive
application
range.
CPU
module
,base
Since
the
above
modules
use
DC5V
and
3.3V
circuits
internally,
they
are
not
subject
to
the
low
voltage
command.
Special,
Communication
module
Special and communication modules are DC24V or less in rated voltage, therefore they are out of the low-voltage

Describes
of
terms
Before using this product, explain the general terms of Ethernet module. Please refer to the Ethernet technical book for
details.
Auto-MDIX(Automatic Medium Dependent Interface Crossover) The type of Ethernet cable is divided into Crossover
Cable (TX-RX, RX-TX) and Straight Cable (TX-TX, RX-RX), where the TX / RX is interchanged based on TX / RX.
Communication of each network device is possible through connection of TX (node A) -RX (node B) / RX (node A) -TX
(node B), so it is impossible to communicate with Straight Cable. However, if there is a function that can electrically
exchange
TX
and
RX
in
the
connected
node,
it
is
possible
to
communicate
with
each
other
using
a
straight
cable,
which
is
called
Auto-MDIX.
Auto-Negotiation Ethernet is the process by which Ethernet devices exchange information about performance, such as
operation
speed
and
duplex
mode.

Each
client
checks
if
there
is
any
sign
prior
to
transmission
of data
to
the
network
(Carrier
Sense)
and
then
sends
its
data
when
the
network
is
empty.
At
this
time,
all
the
clients
have
the
equal
right
to
send
(Multiple
Access).
If
two
or
more
